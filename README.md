# Space-Star-project

I'm going to folllow this lecture series https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3jLiVc5sr3P7Uov0VFsEfwPOEG1rF-FO&si=E_Oa31QrDFQQWur4 in order to build a software which will help us detect the information regarding any distant galaxy, star and their frequency shift and more information. I've just started this project, if you are interested, let me know.
